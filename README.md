# WalkUnlock

### Live a more active life

Lots of people (me included) spend too long browsing social media and not enough time outside.
WalkUnlock aims to combat that by requireing a step "cost" to using applications.

This is both an incentive to **walk more** and to spend **less time mindlessly scrolling** though social media.

## Features

WalkUnlock consists of a step counter that deducts steps every minute an app is open in the foreground based on the number of steps the user configures it to cost.
An app can be configured to not cost any steps although any app not on the list will also have no step cost.

Light and Dark theme are supported.

## Installation

Download the .apk file from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/NathanPrazeres/WalkUnlock/releases/tag/latest) tab and install it like any other Android application.

## Development

This application was developed for the Mobile App Development 2024/25 Spring Semester course at AGH University in Krak√≥w, Poland

###### Known issues:

- Sometimes launching an app will count as 2 instances causing the locked app screen to show up twice in a row.
- Settings menu is a bit bare bones.
